#Reconstruction algorithm TwIST in C

The Two-step Iterative Shrinkage/Thresholding Algorithm (TwIST) is an algorithm to solve linear Inverse Problems. All information about the reconstruction algorithm can be found here: http://www.lx.it.pt/~bioucas/TwIST/TwIST.htm. 

In this work, the reconstruction algorithm TwIST is implemented in C language.
