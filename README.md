# Coded Spectral Snapshot Imaging (CASSI) in C

Spectral imaging is a technique that generates a spatial map of spectral variation, making it a useful tool in many applications including environmental remote sensing, military target discrimination, astrophysics and biomedical optics. When imaging a scene, a spectral imager produces a two-dimensional spatial array of vectors which represents the spectrum at each pixel location. The resulting three-dimensional dataset containing the two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension is known as the datacube. Coded Spectral Snapshot Imaging (CASSI) is a system acquisition of spectral images.

The Matlab code to reconstruct a datacube from the data are provided in the link: http://www.disp.duke.edu/projects/CASSI/experimentaldata/index.ptml

In this work, some CASSI modules are transcribed from Matlab to C language.
